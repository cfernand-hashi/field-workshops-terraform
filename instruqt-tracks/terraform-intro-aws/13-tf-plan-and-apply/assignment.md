teaser: |
  The `terraform plan` command can be run anytime to get a preview of changes that Terraform might make. When you run Terraform apply these changes are implemented, and Terraform builds, updates, or destroys resources.
notes:
- type: text

    By default, the `terraform apply` command runs a Terraform plan to show you what changes it wants to make.

    Terraform maps out all the changes it needs to make before applying them.

Now that we've configured our required variables we can apply our changes.

Run the `terraform plan` command first to see what will happen:

```
terraform plan
```
Confirm the proper prefix and location are displayed in the plan output.

Then run `terraform apply` and watch your resources being built.

```
terraform apply
```

You'll need to enter **yes** when Terraform prompts you with the "Do you want to perform these actions?" question.

Right now our code only defines a VPC. We'll be building upon this starting point in the next challenge.
