  Terraform is idempotent. Each resource in your code will be examined, and if it already exists Terraform will leave it alone.

    Terraform is an *idempotent* application.

    Idempotence is the property of certain operations in mathematics and computer science whereby they can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application.

Try running `terraform plan` again and see what happens:

```
terraform plan
```

Since your Azure resource group has already been built, Terraform will report that there are no changes required.

This is normal and expected.

Now try running another apply:

```
terraform apply
```

Terraform checks each resource to ensure it is in the proper state. It will not re-create your resource group if it is already provisioned correctly.
