Read the Terraform documentation for the azurerm_resource_group resource:

[Azure Terraform Docs - Click Here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/resource_group)

Add a tag to your resource group in the **main.tf** file using the `tags` argument of the `azurerm_resource_group` resource.

The name of the tag should be `environment` and the value should be `Production` surrounded by double-quotes. The tag is case-sensitive. Make sure you use a capital P. You'll need to use `=` after `environment`.

Be sure to save the file.

Re-run `terraform apply`.
