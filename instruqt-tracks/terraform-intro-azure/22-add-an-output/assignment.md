Open the **outputs.tf** file on the "Code Editor" tab.

Add a second output for the `ip_address` of your web server. It's going to look almost exactly like the first output but will instead output an IP address instead of a DNS name.

Name your output `catapp_ip`.

You may refer to the docs page to see what types of outputs are valid:

[Terraform Azure Docs - Click Here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/public_ip#attributes-reference)
[Terraform Outputs Docs - Click Here](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/outputs.html)

Be sure to save the changes to the **outputs.tf** file.

Run the terraform refresh command to view your new output:

```
terraform refresh
```

You can run the Terraform output command to view all your outputs:

```
terraform output
```

You can click on either URL to use the web app.
