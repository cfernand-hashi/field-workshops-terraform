We've uncommented all the rest of the Terraform code in the **main.tf** file for you. Run a `terraform plan` to see what will be built:

```
terraform plan
```

Now run an apply to build the HashiCat application:

```
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

It can take up to ten minutes for the application to finish deploying. You will know it is complete when you see the Terraform output with your application URL at the end of the run.

Open your web application in a new browser tab by clicking on the URL in the `catapp_url` output.
