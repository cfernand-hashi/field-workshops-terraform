teaser: |
  The `terraform plan` command can be run anytime to get a preview of changes that Terraform might make. When you run Terraform apply these changes are implemented, and Terraform builds, updates, or destroys resources.

    By default, the `terraform apply` command runs a Terraform plan to show you what changes it wants to make.

    Terraform maps out all the changes it needs to make before applying them.

Now that we've configured our required prefix variable we can apply our Terraform configuration.

Run the `terraform plan` command first to see what will happen:

```
terraform plan
```

Confirm the proper prefix is displayed in the plan output. Look for **# google_compute_network.hashicat** and find the output next to **+ name**.

Then run `terraform apply` and watch your resources being built.

```
terraform apply
```

You'll need to enter **yes** when Terraform prompts you with the "Do you want to perform these actions?" question.

Right now our code only defines a VPC network. We'll be building upon this starting point in the next challenge.
